# The Founder of Quant Coding Versity
--------------------------------------

Meet the creator of quant coding versity, he is main author, maintainer and the educator. If you want to know more about me, you move down to the next sections.

## Personal Information
-----------------------

My name is Dr. Saad Laouadi and I am the founder of the Quant Coding Versity. I have a Ph.D in Economics. I am also data scientist, programmer, economist and a researcher. 

My journey didn’t stop at economics; I delved into the world of programming out of sheer curiosity and a love for technology. Today, I am adept in several programming languages, including Python, Rust, Julia, R, and C++. Each language has been a different path to the same destination – understanding and solving complex data puzzles.

 As a data scientist, I find joy in unraveling these puzzles, turning data into insights and strategies. But my enthusiasm doesn’t end there – I also love developing software. It’s like creating a new tool, a new way to interact with data and make sense of it. This blend of economics, data science, and software development isn’t just my profession; it’s my playground.

Every day, I’m driven by the quest for knowledge and the thrill of innovation. Whether it’s through crafting a new piece of software or diving deep into data analyses, I am on a perpetual journey to explore the limitless possibilities at the crossroads of my three passions.

At Quant Coding Versity, Dr. Laouadi’s vision is to create a collaborative platform that nurtures learning, innovation, and the pursuit of excellence in data science and programming. He aims to build a community where ideas are exchanged, skills are honed, and the future of technology is shaped by collective effort and insight.

## Technical Skills
-------------------

I gathered during the last years skills in different programming languages and softwares

- Programming languages: Python, R, Julia, Rust, C\C++, SQL, BASH
- Softwares: SAS, Matlab, Stata, QGIS, ArcGIS.
- Analytical Skills: Statistical Analysis, Time Series, Machine Learning, Deep learning. 

## Educative skills
-------------------

I am a highly skilled educator; in other words, my passion is teaching. I have taught many courses on data science, machine learning, deep learning, Statistical anlaysis, and programming to numerous students and employees around the world.

Since teaching is my passion, and I am talented in it. I believe talent is not sufficient, thus I worked hard to develop this talent, so I acquired an ability to clearly explain complex concepts and make them accessible to students of all levels.

As a dedicated trainer, Dr. Laouadi is driven by his passion for research and education. He believes in empowering others by sharing knowledge and expertise, a principle that is deeply embedded in the ethos of Quant Coding Versity.

I have interests in research in many areas such as:

1. Programming languages
2. Machine learning
3. Deep learning
4. Time Series
5. Image processing
6. Remote Sensing


Besides the analytical skills, I am also a full-stack web developer, I code my own website and blog using several tools such as CSS, bootsrap, JavaScript, and Python.
