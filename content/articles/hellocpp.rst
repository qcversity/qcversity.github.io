:summary: A brief introduction to C++ programming with a simple example.

Getting Started with C++
========================

C++ is a widely-used programming language that offers a blend of high-level and low-level 
features. In this post, we'll go through a basic "Hello, World!" program in C++.

Why Learn C++?
--------------

C++ is known for its:

- **Performance**: It's incredibly efficient and is used in systems where resources are 
  limited or high performance is needed.
- **Control**: C++ gives programmers more control over system resources and memory.
- **Object-Oriented Features**: C++ supports object-oriented programming, making it a 
  great choice for large-scale applications.

Hello, World! in C++
---------------------

Here is a simple C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

.. include:: ../code/hellocpp.cpp
   :code: c++
   :start-after: // begin
   :end-before: // end

This program includes the `<iostream>` library, which is used for input and output 
operations. The `main` function is the entry point of a C++ program. The line `std::cout 
<< "Hello, World!" << std::endl;` prints the text to the console.

Conclusion
----------

C++ is a powerful language for developing software that requires high performance and 
resource management. This simple program is just the beginning of what you can do with 
C++.

Happy coding!
